# GECKHONFT Security Documentation

## Smart Contract Security

### Access Control
- Role-based access control using OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl`
- Separate roles for different administrative functions:
  - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: Full administrative access
  - `MINTER_ROLE`: Permission to mint NFTs
  - `PAUSER_ROLE`: Permission to pause/unpause the contract
  - `ADMIN_ROLE`: Permission to manage whitelist, prices, and other settings

### Rate Limiting
- Maximum mints per address: 5 NFTs
- Maximum mints per transaction: 3 NFTs
- Cooldown period between mints: 1 hour
- Configurable limits through admin functions

### Reentrancy Protection
- All external functions protected with `nonReentrant` modifier
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern implemented
- Secure withdrawal function with reentrancy guard

### Pausable Functionality
- Emergency pause mechanism for critical functions
- Only `PAUSER_ROLE` can pause/unpause the contract
- All minting functions are pausable

## Security Audit Requirements

### Pre-Audit Checklist
1. Code Review
   - [ ] Complete code review by team
   - [ ] Documentation of all functions and their purposes
   - [ ] Test coverage analysis

2. Static Analysis
   - [ ] Run Slither for static analysis
   - [ ] Run Mythril for security analysis
   - [ ] Address all high and medium severity findings

3. Test Coverage
   - [ ] Unit tests for all functions
   - [ ] Integration tests for complex interactions
   - [ ] Fuzzing tests for critical functions

### Audit Scope
1. Smart Contract
   - Access control implementation
   - Rate limiting mechanisms
   - Reentrancy protection
   - Event emission
   - Error handling
   - Gas optimization

2. Integration Points
   - Frontend interaction
   - External contract calls
   - Oracle integration (if any)

### Audit Deliverables
1. Technical Report
   - Detailed findings
   - Risk assessment
   - Recommendations
   - Code fixes

2. Security Recommendations
   - Short-term fixes
   - Long-term improvements
   - Best practices implementation

## Additional Security Measures

### Frontend Security
1. Input Validation
   - Client-side validation for all user inputs
   - Server-side validation for critical operations
   - Sanitization of user-provided data

2. API Security
   - Rate limiting on API endpoints
   - CORS configuration
   - API key management
   - Request validation

3. Wallet Integration
   - Secure wallet connection
   - Transaction signing verification
   - Network validation

### Monitoring and Alerts
1. Contract Monitoring
   - Event monitoring for suspicious activities
   - Gas price monitoring
   - Transaction monitoring

2. Alert System
   - Unusual activity alerts
   - Failed transaction alerts
   - Gas price alerts
   - Balance change alerts

### Emergency Procedures
1. Incident Response
   - Emergency contact list
   - Response procedures
   - Communication plan

2. Recovery Plan
   - Contract upgrade procedure
   - Emergency pause procedure
   - Fund recovery procedure

## Best Practices

### Development
